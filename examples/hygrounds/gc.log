For a list of options, see this file:

Environment variables must be prefixed with "BUN_JSC_". This code runs before .env files are loaded, so those won't work here.

Warning: options change between releases of Bun and WebKit without notice. This is not a stable API, you should not rely on it beyond debugging something, and it may be removed entirely in a future version of Bun.
