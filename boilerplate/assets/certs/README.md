For local development, mkcert generated certs will be stored here.
We do this to allow https://localhost & wss://localhost support. 
Without this, play.hytopia.com requires a bunch of funky browser 
flag workarounds in order to connect to our local server.
This is only used for local development and will be ignored
when your game is deployed to HYTOPIA servers.
